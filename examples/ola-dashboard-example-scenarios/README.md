# OLA - Dashboard Use Cases and Scenarios
These documents describe the Use Cases and Scenarios of the *EDSSI Activity 2.4*, analyzing the way of exchanging Learning Agreement data and notifications between the Sending and Receiving Institutions.

## Scenarios
Eight basic scenarios are examined, the first four assuming that only the Receiving Institution is represented by Dashboard-OLA, the other four assuming that only the Sending Institution is represented by Dashboard-OLA. These scenarios are:
* Scenarios 1 and 5: Accepting before mobility LA
* Scenarios 2 and 6: Rejecting before mobility LA
* Scenarios 3 and 5: Accepting during mobility LA
* Scenarios 4 and 8: Rejecting during mobility LA  

The XML example files that are exchanged between the Institutions are mentioned throughout the 8 scenarios and can be found at the end of the document (and also as XML files in the /src/xml directory).

## PDF files
The two PDF files share the same content, one of them being in a printable form (the one extracted from the Word file).

## Source Files
Inside the /src folder one can find:
* the editable MS Word (.docx) file, inside /src/doc
* the edistable MS Visio (.vsdx and .vsd) files, inside /src/vsd
* the 20 XML example files mentioned in the document, inside /src/xml

Each team that wishes to edit this template to write their own scenarios can choose the format of their preference.
