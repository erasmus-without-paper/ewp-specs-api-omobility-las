# OLA-Dashboard Use Cases and Scenarios
These documents efficiently describe the Use Cases and define Scenarios that detail the interactions between the sending HEI and the receiving HEI under the assumption that one them is being represented by the `Dashboard-OLA`.

They are part of the *EDSSI Project - Activity 2.4* and have been developed by the _EDSSI AUTh team_ (edssi@it.auth.gr). 

## Scenarios
8 scenarios are examined: 
* Scenarios 1-4: assume that the Receiving HEI is being represented by `Dashboard-OLA`, and 
* Scenarios 5-8: assume that the Sending HEI is being represented by `Dashboard-OLA`. 

Briefly, these scenarios are:
* Scenarios 1 and 5: Accepting a LA before the mobility
* Scenarios 2 and 6: Rejecting a LA before the mobility
* Scenarios 3 and 5: Accepting a LA during the mobility 
* Scenarios 4 and 8: Rejecting a LA during the mobility   

## PDF files
The two PDF files share the same content, one is in printable format.

## Source Files
The [src](./src) folder contains:
* the editable MS Word (.docx) file at [src/doc](./src/doc)
* the editable MS Visio (.vsdx and .vsd) files at [src/vsd](./src/vsd)
* the raw XML example files mentioned in the document at [src/xml](./src/xml)


Other teams can work in the format of their preference and contribute their own scenarios.
